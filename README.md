# Diatom Whiteboard

## Details
It's a simple online whiteboard app that I wrote as part of my blog for @DiatomEnterprises
The blog post and examples of work can be found here https://diatomenterprises.com/online-whiteboard-on-reactjs-for-math-tutoring/
As well as the full video example can be found here https://youtu.be/lZbu3gt3HuA

## Development
Please, copy the keys from `.env.sample` and `/client/.env.sample` to `.env` and `client/.env` and set them to make the app work.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
